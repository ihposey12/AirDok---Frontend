# AIRDOK
Welcome to AirDok! This application was created with much love!

For many hobbyist pilots, private pilots, etc., landing at regional or executive airports can be expensive. Mostly because the cost of housing the aircraft in a FBO rented hangar is outrageously expensive. Much like homes, there are individuals that own their own hangar and rent them out. The problem is finding those individuals.

Thats where AirDok comes in! AirDok connects those individuals with the private pilots, hobbyists, families, etc, with ease! As a user, you can quickly find the perfect hangar in a location and rent! AirDok also tracks your trips to make sure you don't miss out. A user is also able to create and read other comments on certain hangars to make sure that it is the right fit! Don't like AirDok? No Need for it? Delete your account with ease!

*Currently, AirDok runs off of seeded data. Therefore the data is not entirely real and does not reflect the real world. It is my hope to have a user generated backend up and running very soon.

*AirDok does NOT collect real user credit information
